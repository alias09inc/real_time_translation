"""Produce a careful ground-truth transcription of a video clip via Gemini.

Unlike the real-time pipeline's streaming ASR (optimized for low latency,
one pass, no lookahead), this uploads the clip's video+audio to a strong
Gemini model and asks for a careful, non-real-time transcription -- with
low-confidence spots explicitly flagged for manual review. Seeing the
slides alongside the audio lets the model resolve ambiguous terms the way
a human transcriber would (e.g. a garbled "KV catch" next to a slide
labeled "KV Cache").

Usage:
  uv run python scripts/ground_truth_transcribe.py \
      experiments/clips/hardest_5min_64m07-69m07.mp4 \
      --out experiments/clips/hardest_5min_ground_truth.txt

TRANSCRIPTION_PROMPT = """You are producing a careful ground-truth \
transcription of the English audio in this video clip, for use as a \
reference in evaluating an automatic speech recognition system. This clip \
is known to be difficult: it contains non-native/accented English, dense \
technical ML jargon, and disfluent conversational Q&A speech.

Instructions:
1. Transcribe EXACTLY what is said, verbatim, including disfluencies (um, \
uh, repeated words, false starts). Do not clean up grammar or smooth over \
repetitions -- this must reflect exactly what was spoken, not a polished \
version.
2. Break the transcript into short lines, each prefixed with an \
approximate timestamp in [mm:ss] format relative to the START of this \
clip (not the original video).
3. You may use the visible slide content to help you correctly identify \
ambiguous technical terms when the speaker's pronunciation is unclear \
(e.g. a slide showing "KV Cache" resolves a mumbled pronunciation) -- but \
only for terms actually being discussed, not to guess unrelated content.
4. For any word, phrase, or short passage where you are NOT confident in \
the transcription -- due to unclear audio, heavy accent, overlapping \
speech, or genuine ambiguity -- mark it inline as [uncertain: your best \
guess] and ALSO list it in the UNCERTAIN SPOTS section at the end with \
its timestamp and a one-line reason.
5. If a passage is truly inaudible, write [inaudible] rather than \
guessing.

Output in exactly this format:

<transcript>
[mm:ss] text...
[mm:ss] text...
</transcript>

<uncertain_spots>
- [mm:ss] "transcribed text" -- reason for uncertainty
- [mm:ss] "transcribed text" -- reason for uncertainty
</uncertain_spots>
