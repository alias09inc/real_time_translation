"""Segmentation-robust ASR word latency via Continuous Levenshtein Alignment (CLA).

`results.csv` today only tracks coarse per-experiment averages
(avg_end_to_end_latency_seconds / avg_mt_latency_seconds are not even in
that CSV -- they only live inside each experiment JSON's `results` dict).
Those averages are themselves influenced by how the pipeline segments audio
into ASR batches, which is exactly the "segmentation bias" that
research_agent/state/papers.json's `polak2026-meta-evaluation-latency-metrics`
finds distorts cross-system latency comparisons in the wider literature.

`machacek-polak2025-cuni-offline-cla-latency` (Section 5.1) describes a
retroactive, character-level "Continuous Levenshtein Alignment" (CLA) method
for computing ASR word latency: align a timestamped gold transcript against
the ASR system's output at the character level, preferring continuous runs
of copy/substitute edits over ones interrupted by inserts/deletes (which
would otherwise align a word to a coincidentally-nearby but unrelated
insertion/deletion and produce a nonsensical latency value). This module
implements that idea against this repo's own experiment corpus, using
`experiments/refs/wjZofJX0v4M.en.vtt` (YouTube's own captions) as the gold
transcript -- no new ASR/LLM calls are needed, this is a $0 retroactive
analysis (h-cla-asr-latency-metric).

Two approximations relative to the primary source, stated explicitly because
this repo's own hard rule is to never present an approximation as if it were
the real thing:

1. **Gold timestamps are per-VTT-cue, not per-word.** YouTube's caption VTT
   gives a timestamp per caption block (typically 1-4 seconds, several
   words), not per-word forced-alignment timestamps like the primary source
   presumably uses. We linearly interpolate each cue's words evenly across
   its `[start, end)` span. This is a real source of noise for very short
   cues with many words; do not treat single-experiment CLA numbers as
   precise to better than roughly a cue's duration.
2. **Latency is reported per ASR-settled group (batch), not per word.** We
   align gold text against the concatenation of each Deepgram
   utterance-group's *final* (most-revised) interim hypothesis, and report
   the latency of the *start* of each group's aligned gold span, not every
   individual word. This is coarser than true per-word CLA, but it is
   enough to compare relative latency across different pipeline
   configurations (e.g. the endpointing-ms sweep) on a shared, config-
   independent footing, which is this hypothesis's actual goal.

Despite both approximations, this is still a genuinely different signal from
`avg_end_to_end_latency_seconds`: that field is computed by the pipeline
itself from its own internal batch timers, so two experiments with
different chunking would report incomparable "average" batches; CLA instead
measures against one fixed external gold transcript regardless of how the
pipeline chose to segment.

    (`playback_offset - asr_start_time`) drifting increasingly *negative*

    i.e. these runs were not paced at a strict real-time `--speed 1.0`, or

    `playback_offset` is therefore not on the same clock as the gold VTT
    transcript's absolute video-time, and mixing the two produced nonsense
    (latencies going more negative every group, unrelated to the actual
    config being tested). `asr_end_time` is a content-position clock, same

    much audio-content elapsed between a word being spoken and the
