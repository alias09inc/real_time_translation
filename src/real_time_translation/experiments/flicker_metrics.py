"""Normalized erasure (caption flicker/stability) scoring.

chrF and latency, the two metrics this project already tracks in
`experiments/results.csv`, both only look at the *final* output. Neither
says anything about how much the on-screen text was rewritten while the
viewer was reading it -- which is exactly the blind spot the simultaneous-
translation literature (Arivazhagan et al.'s re-translation papers; the
survey this module was commissioned from) calls out: offline metrics
completely ignore revision/flicker.

This module computes normalized erasure (NE) retroactively from the
timestamped event log every experiment JSON already contains under
`results.events` -- no new ASR/LLM calls are needed. Two independent NE
scores are computed, because this pipeline has two separate places where a
displayed hypothesis can be revised:

1. ASR-level NE (word-level, English): Deepgram interim results for the
   same in-progress utterance (grouped by their shared `asr_start_time`,
   which stays fixed while `asr_end_time` grows) sometimes don't just grow
   monotonically -- the recognizer can revise earlier words as more audio
   arrives. This is visible directly in the event log, e.g. one interim
   reading "this is after all a high level preview..." followed by the next
   interim for the *same* utterance reading "is after all a high level
   preview..." (the leading word was dropped/changed).
2. Translation-level NE (character-level, per the survey's guidance that
   Japanese has no whitespace so char-level is the right granularity):
   translation_partial/translation_complete events for the same committed
   ASR window (grouped by the `(asr_start_time, asr_end_time)` pair), which
   in this pipeline's chunked-commit mode are expected to grow monotonically
   as the LLM streams its answer (token-by-token append, not word
   substitution) -- so a non-zero score here would itself be a finding
   worth investigating, not just noise.

NE definition used here (reconstructed from the description in the survey
that commissioned this module, following Arivazhagan et al.): for an
ordered sequence of hypotheses h_1..h_n for the same growing utterance,
   erasure_i = len(h_{i-1}) - longest_common_prefix_len(h_{i-1}, h_i)
   NE = sum(erasure_i for i=2..n) / len(h_n)
NE=0 means the displayed prefix was never invalidated; higher NE means more
of what was on screen had to be taken back. This should be checked against
the primary source (not yet WebFetched at the time this module was written)
during a future READ_PAPERS pass -- see research_agent/state/papers.json,
entry `arivazhagan2019-erasure`.

    `group_translation` above groups by `(asr_start_time, asr_end_time)`, i.e.
    a single `_stream_batch()` call -- so it only ever sees token-by-token
    streaming within one call, which is append-only by construction and
    therefore always ~0. Per `_stream_batch`'s own docstring, a continuation
    batch for an in-progress (not yet utterance-ending) utterance
    re-translates the *entire* accumulated source text from scratch, so nothing
    guarantees a later batch's `full_target_text` keeps the same prefix as an
    earlier batch's -- that cross-batch rewriting is invisible to
    `group_translation`. This function groups instead by utterance span,
    reusing each batch's *last* (most complete) text, and computes NE across
    the ordered sequence of per-batch full texts within a span.

    `results.events`/`TimedEvent` carries no `utterance_id` field (only
    `is_utterance_end`, verified against video_segment.py's TimedEvent and an
    actual experiment JSON) -- so span boundaries here are a sequential
    heuristic: a new span starts immediately after any batch whose last event
    has `is_utterance_end=True`. This is valid for these single-speaker
    sequential-utterance experiments but is not a true utterance_id join --
    callers/reports should state that caveat explicitly.
