"""Genuine-endpointing-final vs soft-finalize mix (h-asr-final-emission-latency).

`h-cla-asr-latency-metric` found ASR word latency (via Continuous Levenshtein
Alignment against a gold transcript) essentially flat across the entire
`deepgram_endpointing` sweep (300-2000ms). `h-endpointing-connection-verify`
then ruled out a wiring bug -- the config value really does reach Deepgram's
`connect()` call. That leaves the open question of *why* sweeping it has so
little effect.

`deepgram_client.py` distinguishes two ways a translation-triggering batch
gets cut off:

1. A **genuine** Deepgram-native finalize (`is_utterance_end=True`): Deepgram
   itself decided the utterance ended, via its own `is_final`/`UtteranceEnd`
   message -- this is exactly the mechanism `deepgram_endpointing` (a silence
   duration in ms) controls.
2. A **soft finalize** (`is_utterance_end=False`), forced early by the
   constant `deepgram_max_interim_duration` timer (2.5s in these experiments)
   when continuous speech runs well past `endpointing`/`utterance_end_ms`
   without Deepgram ever emitting its own `is_final` -- see
   `DeepgramTranscriber._periodic_soft_finalize_loop` /
   `_soft_finalize_pending`.

If most batches in the endpointing sweep are soft-finalized regardless of
the configured `deepgram_endpointing` value, that would explain the flat CLA
result mechanistically: the fixed 2.5s timer pre-empts Deepgram's own
endpointing decision before it gets a chance to matter, for continuous
speech. This is a $0 retroactive analysis -- `is_utterance_end` is already
logged on every `results.events` entry, no new recording needed.
