"""Translation queue manager with lag detection and adaptive processing.

CHANGE LOG (2026-02-04):
========================
NEW FILE - Created to fix lag accumulation issue.

Problem: Sequential translation caused 10+ minute lag accumulation during lectures.
- Input rate: ~1 sentence/1.5s = 40 sentences/min
- Processing rate: ~1 sentence/4s = 15 sentences/min (Gemini TTFT)
- Deficit: 25 sentences/min accumulating in queue

Solution: Parallel worker pool processes multiple translations concurrently.
- 6 workers × 15/min = 90/min capacity
- Queue stays at 0-1 items instead of growing indefinitely

Key components:
- TranslationQueueConfig: Configuration for workers, queue size, lag thresholds
- TranslationQueueManager: Manages async worker pool and shared queue
- Workers pull from shared asyncio.Queue and process independently
